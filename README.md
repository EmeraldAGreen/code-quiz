DU Coding Camp Assignment 4

## Description
This is a quiz game website with questions about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. These are the languages used to build the game. The user will answer the questions in 75s or less. Each correct answer gives the user 10 points. Each wrong answer subtracts 5s from the timer. At the end, the user can save their final score with their initials and add it to a list of high-scores. The user can then either clear the list of high-scores, or play again and try to be #1!
